# Simple Towers
A simple 3D tower defense game made in Godot. Everything here is made by me and I'm using this to practice making 3D games.

### Things I've Done So Far:
	- Terrain Gen (unfinished)
	- Camera (will come back later)

### Planned additions:
	- Turrets
	- Enemy Path Generation
	- Enemies
	- UI
